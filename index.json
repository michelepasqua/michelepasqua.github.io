PDF file $\\TeX$ ref In my PhD I developed a methodology to verify, trough static analysis, hyperproperties of computer programs. In particular, the focus is on information-flow hyperproperties, which are very pervasive in systems security. The approach is based on abstract interpretation, a very powerful formal framework for the approximation of programs semantics. My thesis represents the first systematic approach leveraging abstract interpretation to hyperproperties verification.
